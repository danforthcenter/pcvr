R functions for use with plantCV output

## Installation

`pcvr` can be installed using remotes/devtools `install_github` as shown below.

```
devtools::install_github("joshqsumner/pcvr", build_vignettes=T) # to install without building vignettes set the build_vignettes argument to F or exclude it.
library(pcvr)
```

## Usage

Please see the `bellwether` vignette for a general introduction to `pcvr`. In the future we expect to have more vignettes and to specialize each to some degree.

```
vignettes("bellwether", package="pcvr")
```
