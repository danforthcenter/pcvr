## `pcvr` Goals

Currently `pcvr` aims to:

-   Make common tasks easier and consistent
-   Make select Bayesian statistics easier

There is room for goals to evolve based on feedback and scientific needs.

## Load package {.smaller}

Pre-work was to install R, Rstudio, and `pcvr` with dependencies.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
if(!"pcvr" %in% installed.packages()){
  if(!"devtools" %in% installed.packages()){
   install.packages("devtools") 
  }
  devtools::install_github("danforthcenter/pcvr", dependencies = TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(pcvr) # or devtools::load_all() if you are editing
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
```

## What are multi-value traits?

`plantCV` allows for user friendly high throughput image based phenotyping

. . .

Resulting data follows individuals over time, which changes our statistical needs.

## Why use multi-value traits?

## Resources

If you run into a novel situation please reach out and we will try to come up with a solution and add it to `pcvr` if possible.

Good ways to reach out are the help-datascience slack channel and [pcvr github repository](https://github.com/danforthcenter/pcvr).
