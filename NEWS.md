# pcvr 1.0.0.2

Change plotting methods to avoid printing internal labels.

Fixed problems where `growthSim` could simulate changepoint data incorrectly for different changepoints between groups and where the `Stan` `inv_logit` function may not be available for model prediction.

# pcvr 1.0.0.1

New `mvSS` function for simplified interface to modeling multi-value traits via `growthSS`, either longitudinally or at one timepoint.

# pcvr 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
