# pcvr 1.1.1.0

Fixing inelegant failure on `cran` when building the bellwether vignette without wifi and resubmitting to `cran`.

# pcvr 1.1.0.1

Adding arguments to `mvSim` to allow for easier simulation of longitudinal multi-value traits from the growth model options supported in `growthSim`.

# pcvr 1.1.0.0

Allowing for multiple grouping variables to be used in `growthSS` and downstream functions.

# pcvr 1.0.0.6

Fixing `growthSS` behavior with non-integer time options.

# pcvr 1.0.0.5

Added S3 class for `growthSS` and `mvSS` output (`pcvrss`) with print/summary methods.

Bug fixes for brms models using splines without grouping variables.

Bug fixes for brms model plotting without grouping variables.

# pcvr 1.0.0.4

Added error handling for examples that read data from github in case they run in a session without an
internet connection.

# pcvr 1.0.0.3

Changes to `frem` to allow for using datetimes and for cases where a single timepoint cannot be modeled
due to singular grouping.

# pcvr 1.0.0.2

Change plotting methods to avoid printing internal labels.

Fixed problems where `growthSim` could simulate changepoint data incorrectly for different changepoints between groups and where the `Stan` `inv_logit` function may not be available for model prediction.

# pcvr 1.0.0.1

New `mvSS` function for simplified interface to modeling multi-value traits via `growthSS`, either longitudinally or at one timepoint.

# pcvr 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
