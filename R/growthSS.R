#' Ease of use growth model helper function.
#'
#' Output from this should be passed to \link{fitGrowth} to fit the specified model.
#'
#' @param model The name of a model as a character string.
#'  Supported options are c("logistic", "gompertz", "weibull", "frechet", "gumbel", "monomolecular",
#'  "exponential", "linear", "power law", "bragg", "lorentz", "beta",
#'  "double logistic", "double gompertz", "gam", "int"), with "int" representing an intercept only model
#'  which is only used in brms (and is expected to only be used in threshold models or to model
#'  homoskedasticity). Note that the dose response curves (bragg, lorentz, and beta) may be difficult
#'  to fit using the \code{nlme} backend but should work well using other options.
#'  See \code{\link{growthSim}} for examples of each type of single parameterized growth curve
#'  ("gam" is not supported in \code{growthSim}).
#'  You can also specify decay models by including the "decay" keyword with the model name. Note that
#'  using "decay" is only necessary for the brms backend since otherwise the priors are strictly
#'  positive.
#'  In brms models the entire formula is negated for decay models so that lognormal priors can
#'  still be used when at least some coefficients would be negative.
#'  Additionally, the "int_" prefix may be added to a model name to specify that an intercept should
#'  be included. By default these models are assumed to have intercepts at 0, which is often fine.
#'  If you include an intercept in a brms model then you would specify the prior as you would for an
#'  "A", "B", or "C" parameter but as "I". By default growthSS will make student T priors for intercept
#'  parameters in the same way that it will for estimated changepoints (see below).
#'  With type="brms" you can also specify segmented models by combining model names with a plus sign
#'  such as "linear + linear". In a segmented model the names for parameters do not follow the normal
#'  "A", "B", "C" notation, instead they are named for the type of model, the position in the formula,
#'  then for the parameter of that model. There will also be parameters to represent the time when
#'  growth switches from one model to another called either "changepointX" or "fixedChangePointX".
#'  All "changePointX" terms are estimated as parameters of the model.
#'  "fixedChangePointX" parameters are not estimated and are kept as the numeric value given in the
#'  priors, this is useful if your experiment has an intervention at a set time which you expect to
#'  change the growth process acutely.
#'  For the "linear + linear" example this would yield parameters "linear1A", "changePoint1"
#'  (or "fixedChangePoint1"), and "linear2A". A "linear + gompertz" model would have
#'  "linear1A", "changePoint1", "gompertz2A", "gompertz2B", and "gompertz2C" for parameters.
#'  Note that double sigmoid models are not supported as parts of segmented models and gams
#'  can currently only be included as the last part of a segmented model. When using a changepoint model
#'  it may be worth using segments that are simpler to fit
#'  (gompertz instead of EVD options, for instance). Currently "homo" and "int" are treated the same
#'  and "spline" and "gam" are interchangeable. Time-to-event models can be specified using the
#'  "survival" keyword, see details for an explanation of the changes that entails.
#'  Similarly, using the brms backend response distributions (see \code{brms::brmsfamily})
#'  can be specified in the model as "family: model" so that a model
#'  of logistic increasing counts may be written as \code{model = "poisson: logistic"}.
#' @param form A formula describing the model. The left hand side should only be
#' the outcome variable (phenotype), and a cutoff if you are making a survival model (see details).
#' The right hand side needs at least the x variable (which should be numeric and is
#'  typically time). Grouping is also described in this formula using roughly lme4
#'  style syntax,with formulas like \code{y~time|individual/group} to show that predictors
#'  should vary by \code{group} and autocorrelation between \code{individual:group}
#'  interactions should be modeled. Note that autocorrelation is only modeled with the "brms"
#'  backend in this way. "nlme" requires random effects and correlations to use the same grouping,
#'  so autocorrelation using the "nlme" backend works at the group level, so will slightly underestimate
#'  the autocorrelation at the individual level. If group has only one level or is not included then
#'  it will be ignored in formulas for growth and variance (this may be the case if
#'  you split data before fitting models to be able to run more smaller models each more quickly). To
#'  include multiple grouping variables they should be separated with "+" as in
#'  \code{y~time|individual/groupingVariable1 + groupingVariable2}. For some backends multiple grouping
#'  variables will be combined into a single factor of their interaction.
#'  Hierarchical models can be specified for the brms backend as
#'  \code{y~time+other_covariate|individual/group} in which case the parameters of the main growth model
#'  will themselves be estimated by models as specified in the \code{hierarchy} argument. For instance,
#'  if normally "A" had an intercept for each \code{group}, now it would be predicted as
#'  \code{A ~ AI + AA * covariate} where AI and AA now have an intercept for each \code{group}. Note
#'  that if you specify a hierarchical model then priors are required for AI and AA in the previous
#'  example.
#' @param sigma Other models for distributional parameters.
#' This argument is only used with "brms" and "nlme" models and is handled differently for each.
#' When type="brms" this can be supplied as a model or as a list of models.
#' It is turned into a formula (or list of formulas) with an entry corresponding to each distributional
#' parameter (after the mean) of the growth model family.
#' If no family was specified (\code{model="logistic"} for instance) then the student T distribution
#' is used, with additional distributional parameters sigma and nu.
#' To check the naming of distributional parameters in each response family use
#' \code{brms::brmsfamily("family")$dpars}. The supported options are the same as the model options
#' (including threshold models).
#' For distributional parameters that do not have a formula specified they will be modeled as
#' intercept only (not by group).
#' Parameter names are the same as those in the main model but with the distributional parameter name
#' as a prefix. Additionally, if a linear model is used for sigma then it can be modeled with or without
#' a prior, if a prior is specified ("sigmaA") then a non-linear formula is used and the "sigmaA"
#' parameter will be included in the output instead of the default "sigma" term.
#' In the rare case that you wish to model the mean and the 3rd distributional parameter but not
#' the 2nd then \code{sigma = list("not_estimated", "model")} would allow for that.
#'  When type ="nlme" the options are more limited to c("none", "power", "exp"), corresponding to using
#' \code{nlme::varIdent}, \code{nlme::varPower}, or \code{nlme::varExp} respectively where "power"
#' is the default.
#' @param df A dataframe to use. Must contain all the variables listed in the formula.
#' Note that rows with NA or infinite values in x, y, or hierarchical predictors are removed.
#' @param pars Optionally specify which parameters should change by group. Not this is model
#' dependent and is not implemented for brms models due to their more flexible hypothesis testing.
#' @param start An optional named list of starting values OR means for prior distributions.
#' If this is not provided then starting values are picked with \code{stats::selfStart}.
#'  When type = "brms" these should be provided and are treated as the means of
#'   lognormal priors for all growth model parameters and T_5(mu, 3) priors for changepoint parameters.
#'   This is done because the values are strictly positive and the lognormal distribution
#'   is easily interpreted. The changepoint priors are T distributions for symmetry, 5 DF
#'   having been chosen for heavy but not unmanageable tails.
#'   If this argument is not provided then priors are made using brms::get_prior.
#'   Those priors are unlikely to be suitable and a different set of priors will need to be made
#'   for the model using \code{brms::set_prior} for good convergence. When specifying starting
#'   values/prior means think of this as being similar to the \code{params} argument
#'   in \code{growthSim}. Names should correspond to parameter names from the
#'   \code{model} argument. A numeric vector can also be used, but specifying
#'   names is best practice for clarity. Additionally, due to a limitation in
#'   \code{brms} currently lower bounds cannot be set for priors for specific groups.
#'   If priors include multiple groups (\code{start = list(A = c(10,15), ...)}) then
#'   you will see warnings after the model is fit about not having specified a lower
#'   bound explicitly. Those warnings can safely be ignored and will be addressed if
#'   the necessary features are added to \code{brms}. See details for guidance.
#' @param type Type of model to fit, options are "brms", "nlrq", "nlme", "nls", and "mgcv".
#' Note that the "mgcv" option only supports "gam" models.
#' Survival models can use the "survreg" model type
#' (this will be called if any non-brms/flexsurv type is given) or the "flexsurv" model type
#' which requires the flexsurv package to be installed.
#' Note that for non-brms models variables in the model will be labeled by the factor level of the
#' group, not necessarily by the group name.
#' This is done for ease of use with different modeling functions, the levels are alphabetically sorted
#' and can be checked using:
#' \code{table(ss$df$group, ss$df$group_numericLabel)}.
#' @param tau A vector of quantiles to fit for nlrq models.
#' @param hierarchy Optionally a list of model parameters that should themselves by modeled by another
#' predictor variable. This is only used with the brms backend.
#' @keywords Bayesian brms nls nlme nlrq mgcv longitudinal

#' @details
#'
#' Default priors are not provided, but these can serve as starting points for each distribution.
#' You are encouraged to use \code{growthSim} to consider what kind
#' of trendlines result from changes to your prior and for interpretation of each parameter.
#' The \link{plotPrior} function can be used to do prior predictive checks.
#' You should not looking back and forth at your data trying to match your
#'  observed growth exactly with a prior distribution,
#' rather this should be informed by an understanding of the plants you
#'  are using and expectations based on previous research.
#'  For the "double" models the parameter interpretation is the same
#'  as for their non-double counterparts except that there are A and A2, etc.
#'  It is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with the double sigmoid
#'  distributions using growthSim before attempting to model one. Additionally,
#'  those distributions are intended for use with long delays in an experiment,
#'  think stress recovery experiments, not for minor hiccups in plant growth.

#'  \item \bold{Lorentz}: `A / (1 + B * (x - C) ^ 2)`
#'  This models minima and maxima as a dose-response curve where A is the max response,

#'  \item \bold{Beta}: `A * (((x - D) / (C - D)) * ((E - x) / (E - C)) ^ ((E - C) / (C - D))) ^ B`
#'  This models minima and maxima as a dose-response curve where A is the Maximum Value,
#'  B is a shape/concavity exponent similar to the sum of alpha and beta in a Beta distribution,
#'  C is the position of maximum value, D is the minimum position where distribution > 0,
#'  E is the maximum position where distribution > 0.
#'  This is a difficult model to fit but can model non-symmetric dose-response relationships which
#'  may sometimes be worth the extra effort.
#'  }
#'  Note that for these distributions parameters do not exist in a vacuum.
#'  Changing one will make the others look different in the resulting data.
#'  The \code{growthSim} function can be helpful in familiarizing further with these distributions.
#'
#' Using the \code{brms} backend the \code{sigma} argument optionally specifies a sub model to account
#' for heteroskedasticity.
#' Any combination of models (except for decay models) can be specified in the \code{sigma} term.
#' If you need variance to raise and lower then a gam/spline is the most appropriate option.
#'
#' Using the \code{brms} backend a model with lots of parameters may be difficult to estimate if there
#' are lots of groups.
#' If you have very many levels of your "group" variable in a complex model then consider fitting models
#' to subsets of the "group" variable and using \link{combineDraws} to make a data.frame for
#' hypothesis testing.
#'
#' Limits on the Y variable can be specified in the \code{brms} backend. This should generally be
#' unnecessary and will make the model slower to fit and potentially more difficult to set priors on.
#' If you do have a limited phenotype (besides the normal positive constraint for growth models)
#' then this may be helpful, one situation may be canopy coverage percentage which is naturally bounded
#' at an upper and lower limit.
#' To specify these limits add square brackets to the Y term with upper and lower limits such as
#' \code{"y[0,100] ~ time|id/group"}. Other "Additional response information" such as resp_weights or
#' standard errors can be specified using the \code{brms} backend, with those options documented fully
#' in the \code{brms::brmsformula} details.
#'
#' There are also three supported submodel options for \code{nlme} models, but a \code{varFunc} object
#' can also be supplied, see \code{?nlme::varClasses}.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'    \item \bold{none}: \code{varIdent(1|group)}, which models a constant variance separately for each
#'    group.
#'     \item \bold{power}: \code{varPower(x|group)}, which models variance as a power of x per group.
#'     \item \bold{exp}: \code{varExp(x|group)}, which models variance as an exponent of x per group.
#' }
#'
#' Survival models can be fit using the "survival" keyword in the model specification.
#' Using the "brms" backend (type argument) you can specify "weibull" (the default) or "binomial" for
#' the distribution to use in that model so that the final model string would be "survival binomial" or
#' "survival weibull" which is equivalent to "survival". Time to event data is very different than
#' standard phenotype data, so the formula argument should include a cutoff for the Y variable to count
#' as an "event". For example, if you were checking germination using area and wanted to use 50 pixels
#' as a germinated plant your formula would be \code{area > 50 ~ time|id/group}.
#' Internally the input dataframe will be converted to time-to-event data based on that formula.
#' Alternatively you can make your own time to event data and supply that to growthSS. In that case your
#' data should have columns called "n_events"
#' (number of individuals experiencing the event at this time) and "n_eligible"
#' (number of individuals who had not experienced the event at least up to this time)
#' for the binomial model family OR "event" (binary 1,0 for TRUE, FALSE) for the Weibull model family.
#' Note that since these are linear models using different model families the priors are handled
#' differently. For survival models the default priors are weak regularizing priors (Normal(0,5))
#' on all parameters. If you wish to specify your own priors you can supply them as brmsprior objects
#' or as a list such as \code{priors = list("group1" = c(0,3), "group2" = c(0,1))} where the order of
#' values is Mu, Sigma.
#' Any non-brms backend will instead use \code{survival::survreg} to fit the model unless the
#' "flexsurv" type is specified.
#' Distributions will be passed to \code{survreg} where options are "weibull", "exponential",
#' "gaussian", "logistic","lognormal" and "loglogistic" if type = "survreg" or to
#' \code{flexsurv::flexsurvreg} if type = "flexsurv" where options are "gengamma", "gengamma.orig",
#' "genf", "genf.orig", "weibull", "gamma", "exp", "llogis", "lnorm", "gompertz", "exponential",
#' and "lognormal". In \code{flexsurvreg} distributional modeling is supported and additional
#' formula can be passed as a list to the sigma argument of growthSS in the same way as to the anc
#' argument of \code{flexsurv::flexsurvreg}.
#' Further additional arguments should be supplied via \code{fitGrowth} if desired.
