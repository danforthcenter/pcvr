\usage{
pcv.joyplot(
  df = NULL,
  index = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  bin = "label",
  freq = "value",
  trait = "trait",
  fillx = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame to use. Long or wide format is accepted.}

\item{index}{If the data is long then this is a multi value trait as a
character string that must be present in `trait`.
If the data is wide then this is a string used to find column names to use from the wide data.
 In the wide case this should include the entire
  trait name (ie, "hue_frequencies" instead of "hue_freq").}

\item{group}{A length 1 or 2 character vector.
This is used for faceting the joyplot and identifying groups for testing.
If this is length 1 then no faceting is done.}

\item{y}{Optionally a variable to use on the y axis. This is useful when you
have three variables to display. This argument will change faceting behavior to
add an additional layer of faceting (single length group will be faceted,
length 2 group will be faceted group1 ~ group2).}

\item{id}{Optionally a variable to show the outline of different replicates.
Note that ggridges::geom_density_ridges_gradient does not support transparency,
so if fillx is TRUE then only the outer line will show individual IDs.}

\item{bin}{Column containing histogram (multi value trait) bins. Defaults to "label".}

\item{freq}{Column containing histogram counts. Defaults to "value"}

\item{trait}{Column containing phenotype names. Defaults to "trait".}

\item{fillx}{Logical, whether or not to use \code{ggridges::geom_density_ridges_gradient}.
Default is T, if F then \code{ggridges::geom_density_ridges} is used instead,
 with arbitrary fill. Note that \code{ggridges::geom_density_ridges_gradient}
 may issue a message about deprecated ggplot2 features.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot.
