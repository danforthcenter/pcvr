\title{Read in plantCV csv from bellwether phenotyper style experiments analyzed with plantCV versions <4.}
\usage{
read.pcv.3(
  file = NULL,
  snapshotFile = NULL,
  designFile = NULL,
  metaCol = "meta",
  metaForm = "vis_view_angle_zoom_horizontal_gain_exposure_v_new_n_rep",
  joinSnapshot = "id",
  conversions = NULL,
  mode = "long",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the version 3 plantCV output containing phenotypes.}

\item{snapshotFile}{path to the snapshot info metadata file, typically called SnapshotInfo.csv.
This needs to have a column name corresponding to `joinSnapshot` (defaults to "id")
which can be used to join the snapshot data to the phenotype data.
Generally this joining will happen through a parsed section of the file path
to each image present in the phenotype data.
This means that including a duplicate name in `metaForm` will be overwritten
by parsing image paths, so `metaForm` and `joinSnapshot` should not have duplicated names.
 If there is a timestamp column in the snapshot data then it will
 be converted to datetime (assuming a "Y-m-d H:M:S" format)
 and used to calculate days after starting (DAS) and hours.}

\item{designFile}{path to a csv file which contains experimental design information
(treatments, genotypes, etc) and which will be joined to phenotype
and snapshot data through all shared columns.}

\item{metaCol}{a column name from the phenotype data read in with the `file` argument.
Generally for bellwether experiments this will correspond to an image path.
The name is split on "/" characters with the last segment being taken and parsed into
some number of sections based on `metaForm`.}

\item{metaForm}{A character string or character vector of column names to parse `metaCol` into.
The number of names needs to match with length of `metaCol` when parsed.
 If a character string is provided then it is assumed to be underscore delimited,
 so do if you need underscores in a column name then use `c("column_one", "column_two",...)`
 instead of `column_one_column_two_...`.}

\item{joinSnapshot}{Column name create in phenotype data to use in joining snapshot data.
By default this will attempt to make an "id" column, which is parsed from a snapshot
folder in `metaCol` ("/shares/sinc/data/Phenotyper/SINC1/ImagesNew/**snapshot1403**/").
 An error will be raised if this column is not present in the snapshot data.}

\item{conversions}{A named list of phenotypes that should be rescaled by the value in the list.
For instance, at zoom 1  `list(area = 13.2 * 3.7/46856)`
will convert from pixels to square cm in the 5MP bellwether camera.}

\item{mode}{The mode to read data in with through read.pcv.
The default is "long" because this function is built for pcv3 output,
which was generally a wider format to start with than pcv4 output.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{read.pcv}.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe potentially with several files merged into it.
