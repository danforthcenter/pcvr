\title{Run Partial Least Squares Regression on spectral data}
\usage{
pcv.plsr(df, resps = NULL, spectra = NULL, train = 0.8, cv = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing metadata and spectral histogram data}

\item{resps}{Vector of response variables.}

\item{spectra}{Either one column name (in the case of long data) or a set of columns in the case of
wide data. If a single character string is provided and it is not one of the column names then it is
taken to be a pattern that will match some set of column names in the data to use (see examples).}

\item{train}{Proportion of data to use as training data.}

\item{cv}{Number of cross validation iterations.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to caret::train.}
}
\value{
a list of lists each with model performance, prediction target, model, plot, N components,
and variable influence on projection components for each response variable.
}
\description{
Partial Least Squares Regression (plsr) is often used to analyze spectral data.
}
\details{
Note that columns that sum to 0 in the training or test data will be removed.
This function also uses the 'pls' method from the pls package.
}
\examples{

if (rlang::is_installed("pls")) {
dists <- list(
  rlnorm = list(meanlog = log(40), sdlog = 0.5),
  rlnorm = list(meanlog = log(60), sdlog = 0.35)
)
mv <- mvSim(dists = dists, n_samples = 100, counts = 1000,
            min_bin = 1, max_bin = 180, wide = TRUE)

                params = list("A" = c(200, 160), "B" = c(13, 11), "C" = c(3, 3.5))
)
d <- cbind(sv, mv[, -1])
# note that this requires the "pls" package to be installed.
x <- pcv.plsr(df = d, resps = "y", spectra = grepl("^sim_", colnames(d)))
