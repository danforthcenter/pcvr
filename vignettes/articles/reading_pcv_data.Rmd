# Example Bellwether (Lemnatech) Workflow

```{r}
library(pcvr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
```


The Bellwether phenotyping facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center allows for high throughput image based phenotyping of up to 1140 plants over the course of several weeks. This generates a massive amount of image data which is typically analysed using plantCV, a python based image analysis tool developed and maintained by the Data Science Core Facility at DDPSC. The plantCV output from a Bellwether experiment consists of numeric phenotypes commonly broken into two categories, single value traits and multi value traits. Single value traits are phenotypes where one image yields one value, things like plant height or plant area. Multi value traits require multiple numbers to describe a single image and currently are limited to color histograms in various color spaces. Here we will focus only on the hue channel of HSV color, but there are lots of options with your data. This package is being developed to help with common analysis tasks that arise in using plantCV output. If your goal or experiment seems to be unsupported then please consider raising an [issue on github](https://github.com/danforthcenter/pcvr) so we can know what directions to take development in for the future.

## Read In Data

This tutorial just shows some common things to check when reading in `PlantCV` output, particularly from lemnatech style phenotyping experiments.

### `read.pcv`

Bellwether data can be very large so this vignette will use a small bellwether dataset that is already subset to remove most multi-value traits (most color histograms). Both the [single value data](https://github.com/joshqsumner/pcvrTestData) and [multi value data](https://github.com/joshqsumner/pcvrTestData) are available on github. For single value traits being read into wide format there is not a compelling reason to use `read.pcv` in place directly calling `fread` or `read.csv`. The benefits of `read.pcv` are only shown if you need to filter data outside of R or if you want to use your data in a different format than it is stored in (wide going to long and vice versa).

The single value traits can be read in with `read.pcv`, here using `data.table::fread` for speed.

```{r}
base_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshqsumner/pcvrTestData/main/"
base_url2 <- "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/joshqsumner/pcvrTestData/main/"
sv <- read.pcv(
  filepath = paste0(base_url, "pcv4-single-value-traits.csv"),
  reader = "fread"
)
```

You will generally want to join some metadata to your phenotypes or parse metadata from your barcodes. Metadata key files will generally look and be used like this:

```{r}
key <- read.csv(paste0(base_url, "smallPhenotyperRun_key.csv"))
head(key)
sv <- merge(sv, key, by = "barcode")
table(sv$genotype, sv$fertilizer)
```

If we did not have a key file then we would parse our barcodes doing something like this:

```{r}
genotype <- substr(sv$barcode, 3, 5)
genotype <- ifelse(genotype == "002", "B73",
  ifelse(genotype == "003", "W605S",
    ifelse(genotype == "004", "MM", "Mo17")
  )
)
fertilizer <- substr(sv$barcode, 8, 8)
fertilizer <- ifelse(fertilizer == "A", 100,
  ifelse(fertilizer == "B", 50, 0)
)
table(genotype, fertilizer)
```

Here we'll also convert some of the phenotypes from pixel units to meaningful units. Here we know that the chips on our color card are 1.2cm on each side, so we can use the following conversion. You can convert these phenotypes to whatever units you like, but you need to know the size of the color card chips in some real unit and color correct in plantCV so that the color chip measurements are returned.

```{r}
chip_size_px <- mean(c(sv$median_color_chip_height_median, sv$median_color_chip_width_median)) # ~52

px_per_cm <- chip_size_px / 1.2 # ~ 43.5
pixels_per_cmsq <- px_per_cm^2 # ~ 1890

sv$area_cm2 <- sv$area_pixels / pixels_per_cmsq
sv$height_cm <- sv$height_pixels / px_per_cm
```


### Very large datasets

Sometimes large plantCV output may be too large to be read into memory for R. In that case `read.pcv` has a `filter` argument which will filter rows using awk through linux/unix outside of R. That feature would work as shown below to read only single value traits into memory. This can take a few minutes but allows the entirely workflow to be documented in one R file. 


```{r, class.source="static-code", eval=F}
example <- read.pcv("prohibitivelyLargeFile.csv",
  filters = list(
    "trait in area_pixels, area_above_reference_pixels, area_below_reference_pixels",
    "sample in default"
  )
)
```

### `read.pcv.4.x`

Before the release of PlantCV version 4 there were several widely used branches of PlantCV that output results as a single long format csv file. The original goal of `read.pcv` was to make it easier to work with those files. Now that the default output has changed the `read.pcv` function has been somewhat simplified but it can still be used for these "PlantCV 4.x" legacy style data.

```{r, class.source="static-code", eval=F}
sv <- read.pcv(paste0(base_url2, "smallPhenotyperRun.csv"),
  mode = "wide",
  reader = "fread"
)

if (TRUE) { # we can parse barcodes for the metadata that we need
  sv$genotype <- substr(sv$barcode, 3, 5)
  sv$genotype <- ifelse(sv$genotype == "002", "B73",
    ifelse(sv$genotype == "003", "W605S",
      ifelse(sv$genotype == "004", "MM", "Mo17")
    )
  )
  sv$fertilizer <- substr(sv$barcode, 8, 8)
  sv$fertilizer <- ifelse(sv$fertilizer == "A", "100",
    ifelse(sv$fertilizer == "B", "50", "0")
  )
} else { # or we might use a key file and join it to our data
  key <- read.csv(paste0(base_url, "smallPhenotyperRun_key.csv"))
  sv <- merge(sv, key, by = "barcode")
}
```


### `read.pcv.3`

Legacy Bellwether data (plantCV version 3 output) can also be read in with `read.pcv.3` which is a wrapper around `read.pcv` which attempts to do several common tasks related bellwether data joining internally. This should be considered experimental as it is based on plantCV version 3 and earlier outputs/bellwether experiments can take many formats and this has only been considered with a few datasets. With the older plantCV output the data is already in a wider format so here the default mode is "long". Note that while `read.pcv` works fine with this older data and still has some added benefits the reasons to use it in place of `data.table::fread` or `base::read.csv` are less compelling.

Here we have examples of reading in various amounts of plantCV 3 bellwether data. In the final example we also list a conversion to take area from pixels to $\text{cm}^2$ for the 5MP camera that was used prior to 2023. Note that the conversion would change for a different camera such as the current 18MP camera. It is a good idea to check your color chip sizes if you are not sure about the appropriate conversion.

```{r, eval=F}
onlyPhenos <- read.pcv.3(file = paste0(base_url, "pcv3Phenos.csv"), metaCol = NULL)
colnames(onlyPhenos)

phenosAndMeta <- read.pcv.3(
  file = paste0(base_url, "pcv3Phenos.csv"), metaCol = "meta",
  metaForm = "vis_view_angle_zoom_horizontal_gain_exposure_v_new_n_rep",
  joinSnapshot = "id"
)
colnames(phenosAndMeta)

all <- read.pcv.3(
  file = paste0(base_url, "pcv3Phenos.csv"),
  snapshotFile = paste0(base_url, "pcv3Snapshot.csv"),
  designFile = paste0(base_url, "pcv3Design.csv"),
  metaCol = "meta", metaForm = "vis_view_angle_zoom_horizontal_gain_exposure_v_new_n_rep",
  joinSnapshot = "id", conversions = list(area = 13.2 * 3.7 / 46856)
)
colnames(all)
```


### Other metadata

Often we want to convert our timestamp data from the lemnatech into either days after start (DAS), days after planting (DAP), or days after emergence (DAE). By default the `bw.time` function will add columns called DAS, DAP, and DAE to your data. Days after emergence requires using a phenotype and a value to classify emergence. Here an area greater than 10 pixels is considered an emerged plant. In this example with a planting delay of 0 DAP and DAE will be the same, but both are still created for the purpose of the example.

```{r}
out <- bw.time(sv,
  plantingDelay = 0, phenotype = "area_pixels", cutoff = 10,
  timeCol = "timestamp", group = c("barcode", "rotation"), plot = TRUE
)
out$plot
sv <- out$data
dim(sv)
```

Note that in these plots, and particularly clearly in the DAE plot, there are lots of plants which show a vertical line on their last day, indicating that our grouping might be incorrect. For this data that is due to the imaging schedule changing and getting 2 separate images at each rotation on the last day.

Before moving on we'll also check the grouping in our data. Here we see that we have lots of plants with more than one image per day.

```{r}
checkGroups(sv, c("DAS", "barcode", "rotation", "genotype", "fertilizer"))
```


We can combine images taken at different angles of the same plant on a given day with `aggregate`, where we will also remove some columns we aren't using. In this case we use the mean of observations, but some people prefer a sum. Either way is fine. Here we also remove the DAE and DAP columns since we will not be using them. 

```{r}
phenotypes <- colnames(sv)[c(19:35, 43:45, 48:49)]
phenoForm <- paste0("cbind(", paste0(phenotypes, collapse = ", "), ")")
groupForm <- "DAS+timestamp+barcode+genotype+fertilizer"
form <- as.formula(paste0(phenoForm, "~", groupForm))
sv_ag_with_outliers <- aggregate(form, data = sv, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
dim(sv_ag_with_outliers)
```


### Outlier Removal

The `bw.outliers` function can be used to remove outliers relative to a phenotype using cook's distance. Here due to the experimental design having these plants germinate on the machine around 1 percent of data are removed as outliers. The plot shows removed data points in red, although here that is hard to see.

```{r}
out <- bw.outliers(
  df = sv_ag_with_outliers, phenotype = "area_pixels",
  group = c("DAS", "genotype", "fertilizer"), plotgroup = c("barcode")
)
sv_ag <- out$data
out$plot
dim(sv_ag)
```

It is also useful to check our grouping assumptions again, here we see that there are some plants with multiple images from a single day.

```{r}
checkGroups(sv_ag, c("DAS", "barcode", "genotype", "fertilizer"))
```


### Watering Data

We might also want to check the watering data, which can be read easily from json with `bw.water`.

```{r}
water <- bw.water(paste0(base_url, "metadata.json"))

water$genotype <- substr(water$barcode, 3, 5)
water$genotype <- ifelse(water$genotype == "002", "B73",
  ifelse(water$genotype == "003", "W605S",
    ifelse(water$genotype == "004", "MM", "Mo17")
  )
)
water$fertilizer <- substr(water$barcode, 8, 8)
water$fertilizer <- ifelse(water$fertilizer == "A", "100",
  ifelse(water$fertilizer == "B", "50", "0")
)

ggplot(water[water$weight_after != -1, ], aes(
  x = DAS,
  y = water_amount, group = barcode, color = genotype
)) +
  facet_wrap(~ factor(fertilizer, levels = c("0", "50", "100"))) +
  geom_line() +
  pcv_theme() +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Condition", override.aes = list(linewidth = 5))) +
  labs(y = "Watering Amount (g)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

A common use for watering data is to look at water use efficiency (WUE). Here we can calculate an approximation of WUE based on the change in some phenotype (area) over the change in weight between waterings. Note that the plants in this example are very young and as such the data in this example is dominated by noise.


```{r}
test <- pwue(df = sv_ag, w = water, pheno = "area_pixels", time = "timestamp", id = "barcode")

ggplot(test, aes(x = DAS, y = pWUE, color = genotype, group = barcode)) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 5))) +
  labs(y = expression("Pseudo WUE (" ~ frac(
    Delta ~ textstyle("Area")[" pixels"],
    Delta ~ textstyle("Weight")[" g"]
  ) ~ ")")) +
  pcv_theme()
```


## Multi Value Traits

We take similar steps in working with multi-value trait data.

```{r}
hue_wide <- read.pcv(paste0(base_url2, "pcv4-multi-value-traits.csv"),
  mode = "wide", reader = "fread"
)
hue_wide$genotype <- substr(hue_wide$barcode, 3, 5)
hue_wide$genotype <- ifelse(hue_wide$genotype == "002", "B73",
  ifelse(hue_wide$genotype == "003", "W605S",
    ifelse(hue_wide$genotype == "004", "MM", "Mo17")
  )
)
hue_wide$fertilizer <- substr(hue_wide$barcode, 8, 8)
hue_wide$fertilizer <- ifelse(hue_wide$fertilizer == "A", "100",
  ifelse(hue_wide$fertilizer == "B", "50", "0")
)
hue_wide <- bw.time(hue_wide, timeCol = "timestamp", group = "barcode", plot = FALSE)

phenotypes <- colnames(hue_wide)[grepl("hue_frequencies", colnames(hue_wide))]
phenoForm <- paste0("cbind(", paste0(phenotypes, collapse = ", "), ")")
groupForm <- "DAS+barcode+genotype+fertilizer"
form <- as.formula(paste0(phenoForm, "~", groupForm))
hue_wide <- aggregate(form, data = hue_wide, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Conclusion

These data can be used in the same way as the simulated data in the Bellwether vignette. The Bellwether vignette originally used these data, but for combatibility with `CRAN` standards now uses lighter simulated data rather than data hosted online. See that or other vignettes/articles for notes about analysis.
